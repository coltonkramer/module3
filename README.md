# Overview

## Reason
I am trying to learn Android Studio by creating an app that changes color values within the app

## Description
You're supposed to be able to click a button and it will change the background color but the app always crashes when I run it

## Description
My purpose for creating this app is to make myself a more well rounded programmer

## Demo
Nothing to demo the app is broken :(

## Development Environment

I used Andriod Studio in Java
No additional libraries were used

## Useful Websites

* Android Developer Website https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp

## Future Work

* accessing the background id doesnt work for some reason
